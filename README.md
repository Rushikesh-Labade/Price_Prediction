Predicting Laptop prices based on various factors using Regression Analysis.

The project aims to predict the sale price of Laptops based on various factors using multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random forest, Boosting and KNN. The project's ultimate goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can be used by Buyers and Sellers to make informed decisions about buying and selling Laptops.

To achieve this goal, the project will begin by gathering a comprehensive dataset of Laptop Data Features, such as Company, Type, ram, weight, touchscreen, pixel and operating system. 

Using the gathered dataset, the project will implement each of the regression techniques mentioned above and compare their performance. Decision Tree regression will serve as the basefit model, while XGBoosting, Random Forest and others will be used to improve model performance by addressing issues such as overfitting and multicollinearity.

Once the models have been developed and tested, the project will evaluate their predictive accuracy using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The model with the highest accuracy will be selected and presented as the final product of the project.

Overall, the project's success will be measured by its ability to develop an accurate predictive model that can be utilized by buyers and sellers to make informed decisions about buying and selling Laptops. By doing so, the project will provide valuable insights into the factors that affect Laptop sales prices and help stakeholders in the real life to make more informed decisions.
